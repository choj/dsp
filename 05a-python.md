# Learn Python

Read Allen Downey's [Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) for getting up to speed with Python 2.7 and computer science topics. It's completely available online, or you can buy a physical copy if you would like.

For quick and easy interactive practice with Python, many people enjoy [Codecademy's Python track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python). There's also [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/).

###Q1. Lists &amp; Tuples

How are Python lists and tuples similar and different? Which will work as keys in dictionaries? Why?

###A1.


Lists and tuples both store multiple items under a single name. Lists can be modified, tuples are immutable. Tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries

###Q2. Lists &amp; Sets

How are Python lists and sets similar and different? Give examples of using both. How does performance compare between lists and sets for finding an element. Why?

###A2.

Lists and sets are similar in that they can hold multiple elements. Sets are different in that they are unordered, and contain only unique elements.

Defining a list: `a = [1,2,3]`

Defining a set: `a = {1,3,5}`

Locating an element in a list or set: `1 in a` (returns `True`)

Sets are faster in finding an element. This is because sets are implemented using hash tables. Locating the element only requires checking the location in memory specified by the hash generated by the respective value, whereas lists require checking each item for matching.

###Q3. Lambda Function

Describe Python's `lambda`. What is it, and what is it used for? Give at least one example, including an example of using a `lambda` in the `key` argument to `sorted`.

###A3.

`lambda` lets one define anonymous functions inline:

`g = lambda x: x**2`

`g(2) = 4`

It can be used as a key with `sorted` to alter the elements of the `sorted` parameter prior to sorting:

`sorted([3,1,2], key=lambda x: 1/x)`

###Q4. List Comprehension, Map &amp; Filter

Explain list comprehensions. Give examples and show equivalents with `map` and `filter`. How do their capabilities compare? Also demonstrate set comprehensions and dictionary comprehensions.

###A4.

A list comprehension is a compact way of writing an expression acting on each element of a list. A simple example:

`>>> x = [1,2,3,4]`

`>>> [1/x_i for x_i in x]`

`[1.0, 0.5, 0.3333333333333333, 0.25]`

This can also be accomplished with `map`:

`>>> inv = lambda x: 1/x`

`>>> list(map(inv,x))`

`filter` can be used to output elements of a list that are true according to a function containing a conditional:

`>>> list(filter(lambda x: x % 2,x))`

`[1, 3]`

A set comprehension is similar to a list comprehension
`>>> a = {1,3,5}`

`>>> {i**2 for i in a}`

`{1, 9, 25}`

A dictionary comprehension follows similarly, and operates on the keys of the dictionary:

`>>> d = {1:"apple", 2:"pear", 3:"orange"}`

`>>> {i**2 for i in d}`

`{1, 4, 9}`
